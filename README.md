i found this command helpful

```
sudo apt-get install python-dev-is-python3 libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsdl1.2-dev libsmpeg-dev python-numpy subversion libportmidi-dev ffmpeg libswscale-dev libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libfreetype6-dev
```

also, probably don't use the requirements.txt to install...
installing the more recent versions of the packages listed there helped us
restore the raspi 4 in may 2025, and `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` gave me trouble
